Type-1 Records: Header Records
Information about the EFT file itself.

"1.001":"LEN", # LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH
The total count of the number of bytes in this Type-1 logical record. Field 1.01 shall begin with "1.01:", followed by the length of the record including every character of every field contained in the record and the information separators. The number of characters added to the record by the LEN field itself shall be included in calculating the value of LEN.

"1.002":"VER", # VERSION
This field should always be 0200

"1.003":"CNT", # FILE CONTENT
List each of the logical records in the logical file by record type. Also specifies the order in which the remaining logical records shall appear in the file. Consist of one or more subfields. Each subfield shall contain two information items describing a single logical record found in the current logical file. The subfields shall be entered in the same order in which the logical records shall be transmitted. When more than one subfield is used, the RS separator character shall be entered between the subfields. With the addition of the Type-10 record, the first information item of each subfield may now be a one- or two-digit integer (giving the logical record type.) The remaining edit
specifications pertaining to CNT are unchanged.

The first subfield shall relate to this Type-1 transaction record. The first information item within this subfield shall be the single character indicating that this is a Type-1 record consisting of header information (the numeral "1" selected from the ANSI Standard Table 1). The second information item of this subfield shall be the sum of the Type-2 plus Type-3 plus Type-4 plus Type-5 plus Type-6 plus Type-7 plus Type-8 plus Type-9 plus Type-10 records contained in this logical file. This number is also equal to the count of the remaining subfields of Field 1.03. The US separator character shall be entered between the first and second information
items.

The remaining subfields of Field 1.03 pertaining to Type-2, Type-3, Type-4, Type-5, Type-6, Type-7, Type-8, Type-9 and Type-10 records contained in the file shall each be comprised of two information items. The first information item shall be one or two characters chosen from one of the following: the ANSI Standard Table 1 that states the record type. The second information item shall be the IDC associated with the logical record pertaining to that subfield.
The IDC shall be a positive integer equal to or greater than zero. The US character shall be used to separate the two information items.

For example, 19920601 represents June 1, 1992. The complete date shall not exceed the current date.

Type-14 Records
Explanation: For non-criminal justice purposes (eg: when 1.004 = FAUF), Type-14 records will be 2x Plain Simultaneous 4 Finger Impressions (Left slap + Right Slap) and 1x record containing the combined Left and Right Thumb Impression.

"14.005":"LCD", # TENPRINT CAPTURE DATE
Should always match the value in 1.005

"14.006":"HLL", # HORIZONTAL LINE LENGTH
Contains the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of the transmitted image.

"14.007":"VLL", # VERTICAL LINE LENGTH
Contains the number of horizontal lines contained in the transmitted image.

"14.008":"SLC", # SCALE UNITS

"14.013":"FGP", # FINGER POSITION
Contain finger position code that matches the ten-print image, entered as a one- or two-character
ASCII subfield (Plain right four fingers = 13, plain left four fingers = 14, left and right thumbs = 15).

"14.021":"SEG", # FINGERPRINT SEGMENT POSITION(S)
Contains offsets to the locations of image segments containing the individual fingers within the image. The offsets are relative to the origin, (0,0), which is in the upper left corner of the image. The horizontal offsets (X) are the pixel counts to the right, and the vertical offsets (Y) are the pixel counts down.

A finger segment is defined by the FINGER NUMBER, the X coordinates (LEFT, RIGHT) and the Y coordinates (TOP, BOTTOM), of its bounding box. The five information items within a finger segment definition are separated by the <US> separator. Individual finger segment definitions are separated by the <RS> separator

"14:021:a":"FRSP", # Friction Ridge Segment Position
"14:021:b":"LHC", # Left Horizontal Coordinate"
"14:021:c":"RHC", # Right Horizontal Coordinate
"14:021:d":"TVC", # Top Vertical Coordinate
"14:021:e":"BVC", # Bottom Vertical Coordinate

Remember that individual fingers are TYPE-4 records. Slaps/Thumbs are Type 14 records.
