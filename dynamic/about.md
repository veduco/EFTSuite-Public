# Thanks for checking out OpenEFT 2!

When I founded my FFL in 2017, the idea was simple: this hobby is already expensive enough, let's make it cheaper. Since then, I've offered affordable transfers and free services wherever I can.

Fingerprinting is already one of those services that is insanely expensive for no reason. $65 to do it in person? Nope, we can do better.

I began maintaining OpenEFT in early 2024 after it effectively became abandonware by the original dev. I worked in new features and containerized the app to make it easy to use. But that still wasn't good enough. I wanted something to call my own and wrote OpenEFT 2 (the app that you're using now)! Now, just ahead of the $0 tax-stamp-transition, I'm releasing it for all of you to use for free.

### Shameless Plugs

If you're happy about saving a few bucks on fingerprinting and want to send a thank you my way, there are a few ways you can do it:

**Need NFA engraving?** Of course you do! I offer this to the community via [Form1Engraving.com](http://form1engraving.com/) at affordable prices.

**Need a way to store your suppressors?** I make something for that! [Check our SILNCR](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1543341366/silncr-the-modular-suppressor-storage), a modular stacking solution for your safe.

**Prefer to just buy me a coffee?**

### Tech Stack

OpenEFT 2 is a complete rewrite of OpenEFT using all new logic and a completely different backend. It shares a name with OpenEFT but it written completely new from the ground up. [OpenEFT Classic](https://github.com/Robbbbbbbbb/OpenEFT) will no longer be maintained.
