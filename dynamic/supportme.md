If you're happy about saving a few bucks on fingerprinting and want to send a thank you my way, there are a few ways you can do it:

**Need NFA engraving?** Of course you do! I offer this to the community via [Form1Engraving.com](http://form1engraving.com/) at affordable prices.

**Need a way to store your suppressors?** I make something for that! [Check our SILNCR](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1543341366/silncr-the-modular-suppressor-storage), a modular stacking solution for your safe.

**Prefer to just buy me a coffee?**
